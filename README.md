# Budget Buddy

Budget Buddy is a personal budget app that takes inspiration from YNAB and Goodbudget combining the envelop budgeting concept and intuitive UI for quick and easy budgeting.

## Why Budget Buddy?

Budget Buddy is created for those who wants to be able to budget using the envelope-style budgeting as well as funding the future months to exit the economic rat race but doesn't break the bank.

## Fundamental Features

Here's the rundown of the essential features.

### Unlimited Budget Envelopes

Categorize your budget goals into envelops, naming each for its specific purposes whether its for an expense or a goal.

Each envelope shows your allocated amount for each budget for that particular month. And, yes, you can (and you should) fund your future months' budgets to effectively manage your money. Budget envelopes show your priorities and where your money go.

A budget envelope also shows your available fund in that category and for that specific month, carrying over the money left in that envelope from the previous months.

### Budget Movement

Flexibility is valuable in the world of finance. In Budget Buddy, you can move money between envelopes as you see fit. e.g. Grocery envelope needs a boost and you have available money lying in another envelope, you can move the amount needed from that envelope to cover your need in the Grocery.

### Transaction

Financial activity consists of an Inflow or Outflow of money. Record your daily activities whether an income or an expense against a specific envelope to track your spending or goal and see how your budget progress.

### Read to Assign

It's like a general fund where you can store an Inflow transaction temporarily to be allocated to your budget envelopes later on.

### Accounts

These represents the repository of your money, it could be your bank accounts, cash on hand, or e-wallets.
