# Budget Buddy

Budget Buddy is a personal budget app inspired by YNAB and Goodbudget combining the envelop budgeting concept and intuitive UI for quick and easy budgeting.

## Why Budget Buddy?

Budget Buddy is created for those who want to be able to budget using envelope-style budgeting as well as funding the future months to exit the economic rat race but doesn't break the bank.

## Fundamental Features

Here's the rundown of the essential features.

### Unlimited Budget Envelopes

You can categorize your budget goals into envelopes, naming each for its specific purposes whether its for an expense or a goal.

Each envelope shows your allocated amount for each budget for that particular month. And, yes, you can (and you should) fund your future months' budgets to effectively manage your money. Budget envelopes show your priorities and where your money go.

A budget envelope also shows your available funds in that category and for that specific month, carrying over the money left in that envelope from the previous months.

### Budget Movement

Flexibility is valuable in the world of finance. In Budget Buddy, you can move money between envelopes as you see fit. e.g. Grocery envelope needs a boost and you have available money lying in another envelope, you can move the amount needed from that envelope to cover your need in the Grocery.

### Transaction

Financial activity consists of an Inflow or Outflow of money. Record your daily activities whether an income or an expense against a specific envelope to track your spending or goal and see how your budget progresses.

### Ready to Assign

It's like a general fund where you can store temporarily an Inflow transaction that is readily available to be distributed to your budget envelopes.

### Accounts

These represent the repository of your money, it could be your bank accounts, cash on hand, or e-wallets.
